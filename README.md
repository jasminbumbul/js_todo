![coverImage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasminbumbul/js_todo/master/screenshot.png?token=AK34RGZYXAD2WVOPMFEPP5S73UA42)

-This is a simple website created using html,css and javascript.
A user can add new ToDo items, mark them as completed or delete them entirely.
Saving to local storage has also been implemented, meaning that ToDo items will stay in the local memory even after restarting the web browser.
This website has been made with the help of a tutorial made by https://github.com/developedbyed/
